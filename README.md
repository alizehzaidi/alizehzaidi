My name is Alizeh (Uh-Lee-Zay) she/her   
I am a CS major @ Northeastern University with a concentration in AI!   
Currently looking for co-op during January-May   
Fun fact about me is I love water, any outdoor activity where a body of water is involved count me in   
If you want to access my files, they are currently private repos because of University policy, but can be made public upon request!
